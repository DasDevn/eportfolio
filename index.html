    <h1>E-Portfolio for Devan Eisnor</h1>
    
        <p>Welcome to my eportfolio website! My name is Devan Eisnor and 
            I am currently a student at NSCC. For the past 16 years, 
            I have worked in the customer service industry, gaining invaluable 
            experience in communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. 
            While I have enjoyed this career path, I have recently decided 
            to pursue a new passion in information technology.</p>
        
        <p>This eportfolio is a platform for me to showcase my resume, 
            contact information, personal goals, and certificates 
            that I have obtained through my studies. As you navigate 
            through my website, you will find information about my 
            professional experiences, education, and skills. I am eager 
            to connect with potential employers and collaborators in the 
            information technology industry, so please don't hesitate to 
            reach out if you think we could work together on a project or 
            opportunity.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my eportfolio and learn 
            more about me. I am excited to see what the future holds as I 
            continue to grow and develop in this exciting field.</p>
